# Frontend Sandbox

A collection of front-end projects built with modern web technologies.

This repository serves as a **sandbox** for experimenting with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Angular

Each folder contains a self-contained project or component that showcases a specific concept, feature, or technique in front-end development.

Feel free to explore, learn, and build upon these examples!

## Purpose
- Practice and learn front-end technologies
- Try out new UI ideas
- Build reusable components
- Document personal learning
